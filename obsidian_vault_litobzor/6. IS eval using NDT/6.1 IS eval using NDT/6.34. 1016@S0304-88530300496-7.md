Structural alterations
of ferromagnetic materials, accepted as alterations
of systems of specific defects (non-uniformities),
are closely linked to the details of their magnetization
processes. These links can be more efficient in
some parts of the sample magnetization processes
than in others. This idea led to the presentation of
suitable magnetic parameters (magnetic induction,
B, and/or its derivatives), in the shape of matrices
of elements. Sensitivity of all the mutually
corresponding matrix elements is always scanned
in the MAT method, and the testing is thus
always adapted to the just investigated material
and to the just investigated structural change of
the sample. The most sensitive matrix elements are
then used as indicators of the explored material
degeneration.
