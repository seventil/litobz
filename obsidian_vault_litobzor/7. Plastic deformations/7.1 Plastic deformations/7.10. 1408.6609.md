The Taylor equation was one of the first expressions relating the flow stress of a material to its dislocation density.
Discrete dislocation simulations show that
the Taylor equation is well satisfied as long as dislocations are more or less randomly distributed and no substructure is formed. Once significant dislocation pile-ups form, stress-strain curves deviate from the Taylor equation. Expressions have been developed for the density of active dislocation sources, the rate of dislocation nucleation, and the rate of dislocation annihilation. For low dislocation densities and
very thin films, these expressions may change because of geometrical considerations.

The evolution of the dislocation density depends on both the dislocation nucleation and anihilation rates. Combining Eqs. (7) and (10), the rate of change of the dislocation density with respect to the plastic strain can be written as
