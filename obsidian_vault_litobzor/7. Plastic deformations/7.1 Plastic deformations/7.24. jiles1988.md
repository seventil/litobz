#### Зависимость магнитных свойств от пластики + причины
Some of the properties were found to be dependent on plastic deformation, notably
H,, WH, p;, and BE. Others were not, for example pa and ph,,. The dependences were
interpreted in terms of changes in dislocation densities within the metal caused by the
plastic deformation, under the assumption that we could neglect any changes due to the
effect of magnetic inclusions with plastic strain in comparison with the changes in dislocation
densities.

#### Зависимость твердости от напряжений 
Correlations were noticed between initial normal permeability, hysteresis loss and
coercivity and the mechanical hardness of the steel. It is suggested that these measurements could be used for estimating the yield strength of the metal non-destructively. The residual stress in the material was calculated from changes in the maximum differential susceptibility and the bulk magnetostriction
