It has been reported by several investigators that with plastically deformed nickel single crystals, the initial magnetic susceptibility decreases and the coercive force increases with increasing disclocation density. These phenomena can be interpreted in terms of a concept that a dislocation acts as an obstacle against the movement of magnetc domain walls through the magneto-elastic interaction between the stress field around it and magnetization vectors within a domain wall. Then, it may be considered that, as the reaction, the domain wall may generally be capable of giving a force on the dislocation.
