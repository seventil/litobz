Variations in the dislocation density with the nominal strain for (a) ARB-Ni and (b) NC-Ni as determined by in situ XRD

The dislocation density changes in four different stages as the strain increases. Regions I and II involve only elastic deformation and both plastic and elastic deformation, respectively. Region III shows almost plastic deformation.
Therefore, Region II is the region in which the dislocation density increases to the value of ρII necessary for solely plastic deformation In Region IV, the dislocation density that had increased during deformation decreases rapidly as a result of the unloading associated with fracture. Smaller grain sizes lead to greater decreases in the dislocation density. The value of ρII is evidently inversely proportional to the grain size. This indicates that NC materials possess the extremely high dislocation density necessary for deformation
to progress exclusively via a plastic mode.
In the case of ARB-Ni, there are pronounced differences in stress distributions in different crystal directions during the plastic deformation region, and variations in the residual stress with crystal direction are observed after unloading. In contrast, the stress distribution and residual stress of the NC-Ni changes very little with the crystal direction.
