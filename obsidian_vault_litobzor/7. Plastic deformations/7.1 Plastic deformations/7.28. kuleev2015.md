#### Природа пластики и магнитных свойств
The physical nature of the occurrence of kinks and inflections of the hysteresis loops B(H) in steels after their plastic extension is explained: owing to the appearance of an nsemble of highly compressed grains with a EPtype domain structure upon unloading, the  magnetic behavior of such steel is determined by the competition of two magnetic subsystems with sharply different coercive forces,

#### Зависимость магнитных от остаточных пластикой
The appearance of quasilinear segments B(H) is caused by irreversible displacements of 90° DBs, at which the field of the jump and the residual stress are interrelated via a linear relationship. Therefore, the difference of the fields of the μd(H) peaks (the value of (H1 – H2)) linearly depends on the residual compressive stresses, e.g., on or and can serve for both determining in each particular case (steel grade, εpl value) and evaluating the plasticdeformation value.
