#### Зависимость петли гистерезиса от напр
Hysteresis loops were initially found to become squarer with increasing tension
at lower stress levels, but became less square and underwent the transition between domain wall motion and magnetisation vector rotation at lower magnetisations as the stress increased

The coercive Þeld remained constant or decreased with increasing stress at lower values of tension, but higher stress levels produced an increase in the coercive Þeld that was attributed to the new dislocations that were generated by the plastic deformation
process. This increase was seen to initiate before yield, rather than at the yield point.
