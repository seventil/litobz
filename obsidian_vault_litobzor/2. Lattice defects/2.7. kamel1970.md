Increasing the dislocation density, by cold working, decreased the initial permiability and increased the coercive force. The observed inverse relationship between reversible permiability and plastic strain was explained on account of Kersten’s theory of flexible domain walls. The increase in coercive force with dislocation density was attributed to the need for higher magnetic pressures tQ be exerted on domain walls to have them detached from the increased number of dislocation pinning points. Excess quenched vacancies caused the magnetic pressure on domain walls to leak out and higher fields were thus required to initiate Barkhausen jumps.
