However, during plastic deformation also vacancies and/or vacancy type defects are produced in very high densities which are typically close to those of vacancies in thermal equilibrium at the melting point.

The effect of high vacancy concentrations on the hardening characteristics is twofold:
(i) direct effects by impeding the movement of dislocations (ii) indirect one by inducing
climbing and annihilation of edge dislocations leading to softening or even absolute decreases in strength.

The concentration of vacancies produced by SPD is about a factor 4 higher than that produced by conventional deformation.
