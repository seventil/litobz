#### Влияние дефектов решетки на мех свойства никеля
In the experiments, nanocrystalline Ni specimens containing different numbers of acancies were produced by electrodeposition and annealing, and their mechanical properties were investigated by tensile tests

The effects of vacancies on the deformation characteristics of nanocrystalline nickel were investigated by conducting tensile tests and MD simulations. In the experiments, the yield stress and fracture stress for the nanocrystalline Ni containing more vacancies were  ower than those for the one containing fewer vacancies.

The relationship between the yield
stress, y, and the grain size, d, формула
