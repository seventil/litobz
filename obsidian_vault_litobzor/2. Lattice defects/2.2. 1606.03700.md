Here, we systematically investigate d the effect of vacancies on the echanical properties of Zr based on density functional theory (DFT) Our results reveal that the existence of vacancy will reduce the bulk modulus, while enhance the shear and Young’s moduli. Based on th ese moduli, the ductility and hardness were further calculated . With the introduction of vacancy, the ductility decreases, but the hardness increases. However, when the vacancy concentration is large r than a critical value , a rise in the ductility and a re duction in the hardness occur , which indicates the degeneration of the material. Moreover, it was
