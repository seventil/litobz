#### Изменение магнитных свойств от напряжений (гистерезисы, коэрцитивная)
Plastic deformation affects the hysteretic magnetic properties of steels because it changes the dislocation density, which affects domain-wall movement and pinning, and also because it places the specimen under residual strain.
The result was that coercivity exhibited a linear relationship with inverse grain size
With increasing residual tensile strain, Hc increases (whereas with increasing elastic tensile strain, Hc decreases). Also, with increasing residual tensile strain, the slope of the hysteresis loop decreases (whereas with increasing elastic tensile strain, the slope increases).
In comparing magnetic properties, wecompare hysteresis loops all with the same Bmax
Wefind that Hc and Wh increase linearly with the deformation magnitude, expressed either as the plastic deformation after yield or as the residual deformation which exists after applied stress is broughtbackto zero.
If one compares
to elastic stress effects, it is found that increasing elastic tensile stress decreases Hc,  hereas increasing plastic tensile stress increases Hc. The reason for increasing tensile and compressive plastic stress magnitudes both increasing the Hc is because plastic deformation of either kind causes increased dislocation density, which tends to dominate the magnetic behavior after plastic deformation
