Moreover, there is a linear relationship between hardness and CRS as the values of
CRS are higher. However, the hardness shows the significant declines and deviates
from the original line between hardness and CRS as CRS are the smaller stable values.
According to the above analysis, CRS and micro-structure work together on the
hardness values, and the micro-structure is the most important factor for hardness.
