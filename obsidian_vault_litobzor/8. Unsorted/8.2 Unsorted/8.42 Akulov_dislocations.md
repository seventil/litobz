# The statistical theory of dislocations

It is necessary to determine statistical-average values in order to study not only the probability of different processes, but also to find the distribution functions for internal shear stresses, dislocation anchoring forces, etc.
Until recently such a theory had not been sufficiently developed. The result was that quantitative rules for the rate of plastic flow de/dt as a function of time t, temperature T, strain e, stress sigma, and the derivative dsigma/dt had not been developed. Not even for the one-dimensional case, i.e. for simple tension or compression, had this problem been solved.

Recently an analogy between the motion of domain boundaries and the motion of dislocations has been discovered and it has thus become possible to develop a domain-dislocation analogy which has greatly facilitated the development of the statistical theory of dislocations.
