Effects of internal stress of electroless nickel plating on behavior of local corrosion and solder joining strengths were evaluated varying pH of nickel plating bath. Local corrosion defects increased depending on raising pH due to increasing tensional internal stress of nickel layer. Beyond, solder ball shear strength was deteriorated as raising pH of plaiting bath. The solder voids adjacent to the joining interface between solder and nickel increased depending on raising pH which makes internal strength tensional. It was assumed that local corrosion defects at nickel surface would be a cause of solder voids.
To summarize, it became clear that internal stress of nickel plating layer affected to local corrosion behavior. While compressive internal stress brings few local corrosion defects and excellent solder joining strength, tensile internal stress results in deterioration of solder joining strength due to the solder voids at the joining interface.
