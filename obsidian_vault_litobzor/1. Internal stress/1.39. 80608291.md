The purpose of supplementing electrolyte with an additive is to reduce the unfavourable tensile stresses in the coatings. Management of the process technology allows one to obtain coatings with sufficiently good properties, adequate for their use.
Results of our experiments allowed us to state the following:
• The lowest concentration of cobalt in the electrolyte and the lowest current density, i.e. 4 g.l-1 and 2 A.dm-2, resp., resulted in the lowest levels of the tensile component of internal stresses, namely 4.8 MPa,
• Addition of saccharine to the electrolyte at concentrations of cobalt 2.6 – 2.74 g.l-1 and the lowest current density of 2 A.dm-2 allowed us to measure the lowest levels of the tensile component of internal stresses, namely 2.56 MPa,
• The levels of internal stresses σ in the Ni-Co coatings, deposited from electrolytes with and additive were lower at the measured current densities in comparison with levels of δ in the coatings deposited in the electrolyte free from an additive.
Combination of parameters of electroplating process, particularly of current density and composition of electrolyte in the selected ranges allows one to change the levels of internal stresses in the deposited coatings. Their determination during the deposition process is important from the point of view of the electrochemical process the aim of which is a high quality coating.
