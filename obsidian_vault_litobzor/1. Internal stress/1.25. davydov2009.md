#### Польза нейтронной дифракции
The neutron
diffraction technique has a special position due to the deep
penetration depth of thermal neutrons in current materials.
This advantage provides a large benefit for stress mapping
in bulk components and for in situ material testing.

Recently, the resolution of dedicated
neutron powder diffractometers has been improved below
the limit value d/d ≈ 2 × 10−3 and extraction of other
microstructural parameters from neutron diffraction profiles
became possible. This method is quite attractive especially due
to a chance to characterize the plastically deformed metals in
situ.

#### Нюансы нейтронной дифр при измерении 2го рода
From the point of view of peak profile analysis, two components of line broadening are usually considered: size broadening—the effect of crystallite size, which is independent
of the diffraction vector magnitude—and the lattice distortion, i.e. the broadening component which is diffraction-orderdependent and thus increases with the distance from the reciprocal lattice origin. These properties enable the separation of the strain and size effects. Size broadening is caused by the finite column length of coherently scattering domains where this length is parallel to the diffraction vector (Guinier 1963). Lattice distortions are caused by lattice defects like dislocations, stacking faults, grain boundaries, inclusions, precipitates, etc.

Even at the high level of plastic deformation the grain size is still large and its contribution is possible to neglect, considering merely the contribution from microstrains in the refinement procedure

#### Регистрация дислокаций нейтронным дифр при нагрузке-разгрузке
The proposed interpretation of reversible effects is based on the assumption that diffraction line broadening observed upon loading corresponds to the total microstress of type II and type III, where type II consists of two subtypes, residual (Hutchings et al 2005 p 12) and heterogeneous elastic components. The broadening in the relaxed state pertains to a quantity of dislocation density and is caused preferentially by type III plus a residual component of type II stresses.
