### [[1.2.2 Плюсы и минусы напряжений]]
#### Плюсы и минусы:
The mechanical reliability of bulk materials and thin films is strongly
affected by residual stress and strain fields induced during a machining
process such as casting, forming and heat treatment. A machined
sample with tensile residual stress is prone to the nucleation of fatigue
cracks, whereas a sample with compressive residual stress is resistant to
such events

### [[1.2.3 Природа напряжений]]
#### Релаксация (priroda):
Zhang et al. studied the influence of residual stress
on mechanical properties of a film/substrate system due to creep deformation
and high temperature. It is shown that parameters like the biaxial
modulus, the thickness ratio of film to substrate and the exposure temperature
have a significant influence on the relaxation rate of residual
stress.

### [[1.2.1 Введение в напряжения]]
#### Адгезия (актуальность):
residual thermal stress normal to the interface in ceramic top coat and close to thermally grown oxide could result in cracking and spallation of thermal barrier coatings.

under uniaxial and biaxial stresses, the measured hardness and elastic modulus were independent of the residual stress level, which was verified by parallel finite element modeling. It is shown that the residual stress in aluminum film is much higher than the yield strength of bulk aluminum
Recently, more experimental and numerical studies have shown that the existence of residual stress has a great influence on mechanical properties of thin films
As shown in Fig. 1, however, the effects of residual stress on hardness are so disorder and irregular that no clear relationship can be identified. Here, it is worth noting that these results were obtained mainly in the stage of elastic deformation. Therefore, the mechanical properties may be insensitive to residual stress
Compared with undeformed samples, materials subjected to plastic deformation have different mechanical properties, which are inconsistent with the plastic residual stress
hardness Hres with residual stress increases with the increase of residual strain εr due to the work hardening behavior of Ni thin films.
It is obvious that elastic stress has a small effect on hardness and elastic modulus.
