#### Минусы напряжений - что ведет к разрушению
It is believed that intergranular stresses play a significant role in failure processes, such as
stress corrosion cracking (SCC) and fatigue cracking.

#### Об напряженийх при деформации - важность 2го рода
Our results show that, after 0.5% applied strain, stresses normal to grain boundaries
introduced by plastic anisotropy dominate over the normal stresses introduced by elastic
anisotropy. Small boundaries were found to have much
higher absolute stresses (whether tensile or compressive) than larger boundaries. This was
attributed to the high stresses predicted at grain boundary edges.
The magnitudes of the residual grain boundary stresses predicted is unrelated to the amount
of plastic strain in the vicinity of the boundary and whether it was higher or lower than the
average plastic strain. In other words, in a plastically deformed polycrystal, a soft-hard grain
combination does not imply high residual stress normal to its boundary.
