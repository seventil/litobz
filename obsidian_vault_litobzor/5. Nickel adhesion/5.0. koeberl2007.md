#### Актуальность
Often the thermal behaviour of the base metals is to weak, so thermal barrier coatings were needed. Nickel is generally used for such thermal barrier coatings. Therefore it is necessary to study the thermo-mechanical fatigue (TMF) of this material. The lifetime of these coatings is very strong affected by the temperature loading in general, both described by nodal
temperatures and their local gradient.

#### Усталостное разрушение никеля
The lifetime decreases by increasing the maximum temperature. Due to the high mechanical strain part, according to higher thermal strain, lifetime decreases due to higher plastic deformation during one cycle. The main difference can be seen by IP and OP test conditions. At 375 °C, the OP test demonstrates creep damage, but at 575 °C there is a balance between creep, pure fatigue and oxidation damage.
