The adhesion of electrodeposited Cu, Ni and Ag films on Cu, Ni and Ag substrates has been examined by the adhesion tape test. Different interfacial structures have been observed by SEM, GD-OES and TEM for the different film/substrate combinations and have been discussed in relation to the interface adhesion. Results show that the different combinations of the electrodeposited films and substrates reveal the different interface adhesive feature. Typically a strong adhesion presents in the interfaces of Ni film/Cu substrate, while a weak adhesion presents in the
interfaces of Cu film/Ni substrate, Cu film/Ag substrates, Ni film/Ag substrate, Ag film/Ni substrate as well as Ag film/Cu substrate. The crystallographic coherency existing in the interface of Cu deposited film/Ni substrate suggests that the adhesion of electrodeposited films on various metal substrates is primarily determined by the crystallographic coherency rather than by the effect of voids in the interfaces.

The effect of voids in the interfaces and the anchor effect
described herein have been examined and it was found that
voids generate in the interface between the deposited films
and substrates to mechanically decrease the adhesion of the
films and substrates, while the anchor act as an adhesion
promoter to remarkably increase the adhesion of the interface.
However, such two effects as external factors do not
directly connected with the inherent properties of the
deposited films and substrates.
Strong adhesion exists in the Ni film/Cu substrate,
while weak adhesion exists in the Cu film/Ni substrate
due to the existence of voids in its interface.
